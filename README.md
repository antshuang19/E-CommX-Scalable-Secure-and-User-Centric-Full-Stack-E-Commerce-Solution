# Design and Implementation of a Full-Stack E-commerce Web Application: A Scalable Solution.
---

## Core Features Breakdown

### 1. **User Authentication**
   - **Session-based Authentication**: Secure login and registration pages, with password hashing using bcrypt to store user credentials safely.
   - **CSRF Tokens**: Every form submission includes a unique CSRF token to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery.
   - **User Management**: Admin users can manage user accounts and reset passwords securely.

### 2. **Product Catalog**
   - **Product Display**: A dynamic list of products is fetched from `products.json` and rendered on the homepage.
   - **Filtering and Sorting**: Products can be filtered by category, price range, or sorted based on popularity or price.
   - **Product Detail Page**: Each product has a detailed page with images, descriptions, and the option to add the product to the cart.

### 3. **Shopping Cart**
   - **Add, Remove, Update**: Users can add products to the cart, update quantities, and remove items.
   - **Cart Persistence**: Cart items are stored in the user's session, which persists across page reloads.
   - **Total Price Calculation**: The total cost of the cart is calculated dynamically based on product price and quantity.

### 4. **Checkout Process**
   - **Order Summary**: Users can review their cart items before confirming the order.
   - **Order Confirmation**: When users place an order, itâ€™s stored in the `orders.json` file, and the cart is cleared.
   - **Order Review**: Admin users can view and process orders directly from the order management page.

### 5. **Admin Panel**
   - **Product Management**: Admins can add, edit, and delete products by updating the `products.json` file manually (or via API).
   - **Order Management**: Admins can view all orders placed, including product details, quantities, and total amounts.
   - **Data Export**: Admins can export order details as JSON files for reporting or integration with other systems.

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Password Storage**:
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt to ensure they are securely stored and not retrievable in plain text.

### 2. **SQL Injection Prevention**:
   - Although we are using JSON for data storage, if you decide to scale this system to a relational database in the future, ensure that you use prepared statements and parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection attacks.

### 3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - Ensure that user-generated content is sanitized before being rendered on the page to prevent malicious scripts from executing.

### 4. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
   - Use CSRF tokens in all forms to prevent unauthorized form submissions.
